# cppwebserver

simple webserver with file parsing etc. in c++. utilizes my [tcp-helper](https://github.com/BaumFX/tcp-helper) library.

## getting started

these instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

literally download & compile.

also error handling isnt really implemented because im lazy so yeah be careful or have fun debugging :yikes:

also make sure to have a directory called "wwwroot" in your binaries directory. currently it just parses the url to html files

example: /about/ -> wwwroot/about.html; / -> wwwroot/index.html; /hahayes/ -> wwwroot/hahayes.html

## contributing

if you have any suggestions (such as proper path/file parsing or additional security features), please file an issue or pull request.

## versioning

we dont have that since im lazy and dont do updates.
